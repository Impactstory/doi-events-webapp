                Paperbuzz provides a programmatic API showing how often a
                scholarly article was mentioned around the web.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary source of data is the
                <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/event-data/" target="_blank">Crossref Event Data</a> API.
            <p>
                Paperbuzz downloads data from the API often,
                consolidating events into a database.
                <br><br>
                An example API call used to gather data is:
                <br><br>
                <a href="https://api.eventdata.crossref.org/v1/events?rows=10000&filter=from-collected-date:1990-01-01,until-collected-date:2099-01-01,obj-id:10.1371/journal.pone.0177707">
                    https://api.eventdata.crossref.org/v1/events?rows=10000&filter=from-collected-date:1990-01-01,until-collected-date:2099-01-01,obj-id:10.1371/journal.pone.0177707
                </a>
            </p>
                Metadata comes from oaDOI (Unpaywall) and Crossref, with example metadata calls being:<br>
                <a href="https://api.oadoi.org/v2/10.1371/journal.pone.0177707">https://api.oadoi.org/v2/10.1371/journal.pone.0177707</a>
                <a href="https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1371/journal.pone.0177707">https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1371/journal.pone.0177707</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                You may sometimes see a difference in the amount events between Crossref and Paperbuzz, due to the way Paperbuzz handles Wikipedia events.
                Paperbuzz handles Wikipedia events differently in two ways.
                <br><br>
                First, if a source is cited multiple times on a single page, then that is recognized as a single event in Paperbuzz.
                Crossref would count that as multiple independent events.<br>
                Second, is that Paperbuzz does not save events that are on a pages marked as old revisions.
                <br><br>
